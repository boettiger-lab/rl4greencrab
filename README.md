European green crabs are prolific predators known to cause considerable perturbations to the ecosystems they colonize. This has had a damaging economic effect, particularly for shellfisheries in the western american coast.

This project approaches this management problem from the point of view of Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL allows us to optimize management responses in highly complex quantitative models of the system.
